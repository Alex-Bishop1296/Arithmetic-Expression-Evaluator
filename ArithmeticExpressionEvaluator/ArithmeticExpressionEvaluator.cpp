//  ArithmeticExpressionEvaluator.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
/*  Date: 3/16/2021
    
    Programmer: Alex Bishop
    
    Purpose: Interview Technical Question
    
    Prompt: Write a program to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions.
            Your problem should support addition and multiplication at a minimum.
            You input will be text similar to the following:

            1 + 1

            (3 + 4) * 6

            (1 * 4) + (5 * 2)

            Your output should be the computed value of the expression.
            Write your program in an Object Oriented fashion and be prepared to show us your code and discuss your solution. Do not use the "Shunting Yard" algorithm.
